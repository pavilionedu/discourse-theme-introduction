* title:       Apply mobile-only changes
* description: Like the 'desktop' folder, any file in the 'mobile' folder will
*              only be applied when the user is using a mobile web browser.
*              Note that 'mobile' here doesn't include (most) tablets. Make a
*              change to the .navigation-toggle border-radius rule to give the
*              mobile-only navigation-toggle some rounded edges. When you've
*              finished experimenting with mobile-only styles, head over to
*              common/head_tag.html for the next step.
