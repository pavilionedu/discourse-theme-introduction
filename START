# title:       Discourse Theme Development
# description: This course introduces you to Discourse theme development. It's 
#              made up of a series of units, each of which have a topic in a
#              category for this course on [Pavilion Education](https://education.thepavilion.io),
#              and their own repository on the [Pavilion Education Github](https://github.com/pavilionedu). 
#              Each unit has a series of steps which appear both as posts in the 
#              unit's topic and as comments in the code of the unit's repository. 
#              The content of the steps is the same in both places.
#
#              The best way to take this course is by working through each step in
#              each unit, step by step. It's easier to read the steps on 
#              [Pavilion Education](https://education.thepavilion.io), where you'll
#              also get the chance to have your work reviewed, watch videos of 
#              teachers completing the steps, chat with other students and track
#              your progress.
#
#              This course requires some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript 
#              and a minimum degree of comfort with using your computer's terminal 
#              (the "command line"). If you're unsure if you're ready, consider 
#              taking an introductory course in HTML and CSS first. You'll get more 
#              out of this if you have the minimum background.
#
#              The purpose of this course is to provide a practical and interactive,
#              introduction to Discourse theme development. If you're an experienced 
#              developer or designer there will be some parts you can skim over, 
#              but others where you will learn some Discourse-specific tips and 
#              tricks that will make your theme development more efficient and 
#              effective.

# title:       Getting Started
# description: This is the first unit in a course on Discourse theme development. 
#              The unit itself is also a Discourse theme! You can find a link to 
#              the theme's git repository in the "references" section below. Go 
#              check it out now, as you'll need to "clone" it to you computer 
#              soon (not just yet).
#
#              ### When reading on Pavilion Education
#
#              If you're taking this unit on [Pavilion Education](https://education.thepavilion.io),
#              mark the ``self review`` steps complete when you've completed 
#              them. If a step is marked ``peer review`` or ``teacher review`` 
#              post a comment on the step with your answer and click "Request 
#              Review" to notify your peers or teachers, who will then mark your
#              work. 
#
#              There's a video of a teacher completing the unit in the final 
#              step, which you'll be able to watch once all other steps are
#              complete.
#
#              ### When reading the code
#
#              If you're reading this in the unit theme code, the last step in 
#              a file will have a ``next_step`` attribute with the path to the 
#              next step. If you can't find it, do a search for learning_step
#              in the theme folder in your code editor to see all the steps in 
#              the unit. All units start in the START file and end in the 
#              FINISH file.

#              ``discourse-theme-introduction`` theme, on the 
#              [Discourse Theme Creator](https://theme-creator.discourse.org). 
#              This means that the copy of the theme on your computer will be 
#              connected with a copy of the same theme on the Theme Creator. 
#              Whenever changes are made to the theme code on your computer, the 
#              same changes will be automatically made to the theme on the Theme 
#              Creator.

#              You'll be asked a series of questions. Answer as follows
#
#              ```
#              ? What is the root URL of your Discourse site? theme-creator.discourse.org
#              ? Would you like this site name stored in ~/.discourse_theme? Y

# title:       Preview your theme
# description: Now that your local copy of ``discourse-theme-introduction`` is
#              on the Theme Creator, we need to "Preview" the theme on the 
#              Theme Creator to see the effect of changes we make. Click on
#              "Discourse Theme Introduction" in your list of themes, then
#              click the "Preview" button. 
#
#              This will open a new browser tab where you'll see a standard 
#              version of Discourse. Keep that tab open while you complete the 
#              rest of the steps in this unit, as that is where you'll see your 
#              changes being applied as you make them to your local copy of 
#              ``discourse-theme-introduction``.

# description: To make changes to the code in your local copy of

#              editor. If you don't have a code editor installed, we 
#              recommend you use [GitHub Atom](https://atom.io).
