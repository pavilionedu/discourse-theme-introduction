# description: This unit will introduce you to working with Discourse themes.
#              It assumes you've used the command line before, that you have
#              Ruby installed on your computer, and that you're familiar with
#              basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. Some steps have a "references"
#              section with links you can follow to learn more.

##
# type:        step
# number:      1
# title:       Install the latest version of the Discourse Theme CLI gem
# description: First, you need to install the Discourse Theme CLI ruby gem,
#              by following the steps in the meta.discourse.org CLI topic (see
#              below). If you already have the gem installed, check you're
#              using the version set at the top of the 
#              discourse-theme-introduction/START file, or later.

gem install discourse_theme
// or if already installed
gem list discourse_theme // check the version
gem update discourse_theme // update if needed

# type:        step
# number:      2
# title:       Watch discourse-theme-introduction on Discourse Theme Creator
# description: Now we're going to start "watching" the
#              discourse-theme-introduction theme on the Discourse Theme 
#              Creator. This means that the copy of the theme on your computer
#              will be connected with a copy of the same theme on the Theme
#              Creator. Whenever changes are made to the theme code on your
#              computer, the same changes will be automatically made to the
#              theme on the Theme Creator.

## 
# type:        step
# number:      2.1
# title:       Clone the theme from GitHub
# description: There are many ways to clone the theme from GitHub to your
#              computer. We recommend you use GitHub Desktop when you're
#              starting out. Clone the discourse-theme-introduction 
#              repository to a folder on your computer where you can easily 
#              find it, such as ~/discourse/themes/discourse-theme-introduction

## 
# type:        step
# number:      2.2
# title:       Create an account on Discourse Theme Creator
# description: You need an account on Discourse Theme Creator to use it with
#              the CLI. Go https://theme-creator.discourse.org, sign up for an
#              account and click on "My Themes". These are the themes you have
#              installed on the Theme Creator, and is where your local copy of 
#              discourse-theme-introduction will appear when you start watching
#              it. Click on "API Key", then "Generate API Key" and copy the key
#              to a notepad on your computer.

## 
# type:        step
# number:      2.3
# title:       Run the watch command
# description: Now we're ready to run the watch command on your computer's 
#              command line. Open your terminal and run the command
#              ```
#              discourse_theme watch path/to/your/cloned/copy // e.g. ~/discourse/themes/discourse-theme-introduction
#              ```
#              You'll be asked a series of questions. Answer as follows
#              ```
#              ? What is the root URL of your Discourse site? theme-creator.discourse.org
#              ? Would you like this site name stored in ~/.discourse_theme? Y
#              ? What is your API key? // paste your Theme Creator API key
#              ? Would you like this API key stored in ~/.discourse_theme? Y
#              > Create and sync with a new theme // press enter
#              ```
#              If everything is working, you'll then see a message starting
#              ```
#              Watching for changes in...
#              ```
#              Now, go back to "My Themes" on the Theme Creator and refresh the
#              page. You should now see "Discourse Theme Introduction" in your
#              list of themes.

# type:        step
# number:      3
# title:       Preview your theme
# description: Now that your local copy of discourse-theme-introduction is
#              on the Theme Creator, we need to "Preview" the theme on the 
#              Theme Creator to see the effect of changes we make. Click on
#              "Discourse Theme Introduction" in your list of themes, then
#              click the "Preview" button. This will open a new browser tab
#              where you'll see a standard version of Discourse. Keep that tab
#              open while you complete the rest of the steps in this unit, as
#              that is where you'll see your changes being applied as you 
#              make them to your local copy of discourse-theme-introduction.

## 
# type:        step
# number:      4
# title:       Open discourse-theme-introduction in a code editor
# description: To make changes to the code in your local copy of
#              discourse-theme-introduction, we need to open it in a code 
#              editor. If you don't have a code editor installed, we 
#              recommend you use GitHub Atom. Once you have opened 
#              discourse-theme-introduction in your editor, open the
#              common/common.scss file to move to the next step.
