# title:       Introduction to Discourse Theme Development
# description: This unit will introduce you to developing Discourse themes. The
#              unit itself is also a Discourse theme! You can find a link to
#              the theme git repository in the "references" section below.
#              Go check it out now, as you'll need to "clone" it to you computer
#              soon (not just yet). As you go through this unit, make sure you
#              complete the instructions in each step before moving on to the
#              next. If you get stuck on any step, post a message in the 
#              Discourse topic this unit is connected to, and someone will help
#              you out.

# title:       Install the Discourse Theme CLI
# description: First, you need to install the latest version of the Discourse
#              Theme CLI ruby gem by following the steps in the
#              meta.discourse.org CLI topic (link in the references). If you
#              already have the gem installed, check you're using the version
#              set at the top of the discourse-theme-introduction/START file,
#              or later.

# title:       Watch your theme on Discourse Theme Creator
# description: Now we're going to start "watching" this theme, the
#              ``discourse-theme-introduction`` theme, on the Discourse Theme 
#              Creator. This means that the copy of the theme on your computer
#              will be connected with a copy of the same theme on the Theme
#              Creator. Whenever changes are made to the theme code on your
#              computer, the same changes will be automatically made to the
#              theme on the Theme Creator.

# title:       Preview your theme
# description: Now that your local copy of discourse-theme-introduction is
#              on the Theme Creator, we need to "Preview" the theme on the 
#              Theme Creator to see the effect of changes we make. Click on
#              "Discourse Theme Introduction" in your list of themes, then
#              click the "Preview" button. This will open a new browser tab
#              where you'll see a standard version of Discourse. Keep that tab
#              open while you complete the rest of the steps in this unit, as
#              that is where you'll see your changes being applied as you 
#              make them to your local copy of discourse-theme-introduction.

# description: To make changes to the code in your local copy of
#              discourse-theme-introduction, we need to open it in a code
