# title:       Add a locale string
# description: Locale files are used to manage any static text visible to the
#              user, such as "Click here", or "Menu". Even if you only ever
#              want to display static text in a single language, you should
#              still use a locale file to manage it.
#
#              If you're not familiar with what "locales" are, or even if you
#              are but are a little rusty, first skim through the
#              "Internationalization and localization" Wikipedia article, and
#              the meta.discourse.org topic in the references.
#
#              The ``locales`` folder in a theme is where you can define locale
#              strings you have created to use in your theme. If you want to
#              change locale strings in Discourse itself (not in your theme), 
#              do that in the Customize > Text admin panel instead.
#
#              Each language you want your theme to be localized in needs a new
#              file in the locales folder. Each file should be named by the ISO
#              639-1 code for the language and formatted as a YAML file. Each
#              file should also start with the same ISO 639-1 code.
#              
#              Let's change the ``theme_metadata.description`` locale string
#              below to something else, such as "I made it to step 10!". Then,
#              go back to "Discourse Theme Introduction" in "My Themes" on the
#              Theme Creator and refresh the page. You'll now see your new
#              description text under the main "Discourse Theme Introduction"
#              title.
#
#              We'll cover theme locale files in more depth in another unit.
#              All you need to know for now is why they're here and how to make
#              a simple change to one. Browse through the references to learn
#              more, but don't worry about becoming a locale expert just yet.
#
#              When you're ready, open the FINISH file for the final steps in
#              this unit.
