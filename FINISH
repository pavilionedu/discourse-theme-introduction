# title:       How to configure a theme
# description: The last thing we're going to look at in this introduction are
#              the two theme configuration files: ``about.json`` and
#              ``settings.yml``. We'll go through each briefly now and return
#              to go through them in more depth later in the course.

# title:       How to configure the about.json file
# description: The ``about.json`` file's primary role is to set metadata about
#              a theme. Have a look at the meta.discourse.org topic in the 
#              references for a list of metadata you can add. The ``about.json``
#              can also be used to configure assets and color schemes.
#
#              To see how the ``about.json`` works, add your name to the
#              "authors" value. The convention is to seperate each name by a
#              comma followed by a space. Then go to the "My Themes" panel in
#              the Theme Creator, click on "Discourse Theme Introduction" and
#              refresh the page. You should now see your name included in the
#              "Authors" metadata.
#
#              Experiment with the other metadata, but don't worry about them
#              too much for now. We'll be covering different parts of this file
#              in more depth later in the course.

# title:       How to use the settings.yml file
# description: The ``settings.yml`` file is where you add settings you can
#              change in the theme administration interface. The main point of
#              this is to make it easy to configure the theme without changing
#              the code.
#              
#              Settings are useful when you're developing an open source theme
#              that people will use on different forums, and you want to let
#              them make some changes to suit their forum.
#
#              Settings are also useful when you're making a theme that will be
#              administered by a non-technical forum administrator and you want
#              to let them configure how the theme looks or works themselves.
#
#              We'll be going into settings in more depth in a later unit, but
#              for now, let's see a simple setting in action. Open the
#              ``settings.yml`` file and paste in this line
#
#              ```
#              body_background_img_url: https://pavilion-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/education/pattern.png
#              ```
#
#              Save the file, then go back to Discourse Theme Introduction in 
#              your "My Themes" list on the Theme Creator. Scroll down to the
#              bottom and you'll now see a section called "Theme Settings" with
#              the setting we just added.
#
#              To use the setting, go to the ``common/common.scss`` file and
#              change the ``body`` ``background`` to
#
#              ```
#              url("#{$body_background_img_url}");
#              ```
#
#              Then open up your preview tab, and you'll now see a repeated
#              background pattern image. Experiment by changing the setting to
#              a different online image url.
#
