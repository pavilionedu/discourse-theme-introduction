title:       Add some custom HTML
description: As well as adding custom CSS, you can also use themes to add 
             custom HTML. The various ``.html`` files you see in the
             common, desktop and mobile folders are all just different places
             to insert HTML into the Discourse layout. Which one you use
             depends on where you want the HTML to be inserted, and whether
             you want it restricted to a particular devices (i.e. desktop or
             mobile). There are two broad categories of HTML files, which
             we'll cover in turn.
             <br>
             The files ``head_tag.html`` and ``body_tag.html`` are typically
             used to add site meta, load scripts and fetch assets. Any HTML
             in the ``head_tag.html`` file will get added to the ``<head>``
             in all Discourse pages. Any HTML in ``body_tag.html`` will get
             inserted at the bottom of the ``<body>`` tag.
             <br>
             The files ``after_header.html``, ``header.html`` and
             ``footer.html`` are typically used to add new elements to
             Discourse that a user, or a web crawler, will see as part of the
             Discourse layout. You'll see some user-visible HTML in next step,
             but it's also important to keep in mind what HTML web crawlers,
             such as Googlebot, are seeing when they crawl and index your
             forum.
             <br>
             If any of these concepts are new or confusing, take some time to
             go through the references before continuing to the next step.

title:       Add an asset in the ``<head>``
description: We can use the ``head_tag.html`` to load scripts, or assets such
             fonts. In the ``<link>`` below we're loading a font called New
             Tegomin from Google Fonts. Head over to the common/common.scss
             and add this font as a font-family to the ``body`` rule already
             in that file.
             ```
             font-family: 'New Tegomin', serif;
             ```
             Experiment with adding other tags, such as <meta> or <script>, 
             then see the result using your web inspector in your preview
             tabs. Each time you add new HTML, you'll need to do a full
             refresh of the page. Once you've finished experimenting, head
             over to ``header.html`` for the next step.
