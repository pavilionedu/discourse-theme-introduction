* title:       Apply device-specific changes
* description: Any files in the ``desktop`` folder in a theme will only be
*              applied when the user is using the forum on a desktop web
*              browser. This means that any style changes you make in a 
*              ``desktop`` file won't appear in your mobile preview tab. 
*
*              Make a change to the ``.wrap`` ``max-width`` to see this in action. 
*              This is the CSS rule that sets the maximum width of content you 
*              see on desktop Discourse, unlike the full-width you see on mobile. 
*
*              Once you've finished experimenting with desktop-only styles, if
*              you're reading this in unit theme code, head over to ``mobile/mobile.scss``
*              for the next step.
