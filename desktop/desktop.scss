* description: Any files in the 'desktop' folder in a theme will only be
*              applied when the user is using the forum on a desktop web
*              browser. This means that any style changes you make in this file 
*              won't appear in your mobile preview tab. Make a change to the 
*              .wrap max-width to see it in action. This is the rule that sets
*              the maximum width of content you see on desktop Discourse,
*              unlike the full-width you see on mobile. Once you've finished
*              experimenting with desktop-only styles, head over to
*              mobile/mobile.scss for the next step.
